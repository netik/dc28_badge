Parts we'd probably like to have include the following (assumption is qty 500):

CPU:

ST Micro STM32F746 MCU
This part is available in several BGA and LQFN packages. Flash size is
either 512KB or 1MB.

Availability may be an issue. It's easier to get the WLCSP143 part,
and it's cheaper, but it only has 144 pins. This creates a problem:
there's an unresolvable conflict between the pin for LCD_B4 and the
FMC_D9 memory controller pin. This means it's not possible to use
more than 8 data pins with the FMC with this part, which limits the
possible RAM configuration to 4MB instead of 8MB. This is still
pretty good, but I'd rather have 8.

Note: after further research, we don't want the WLCSP part. (It's not
a chip that can be soldered to a board.) We need either BGA or LQFP.

At qty 250 or more, the STM32F746IGK6 (BGA) price is $8.33
At qty 500, the 511-STM32F746IGT6 (LQFP) is $7.39

SDRAM:

ISSI IS42S16400J-6TL

8MB SDRAM chip
At qty 500, the IS42S16400J-6TL price is $1.23

Alliance Memory AS4C8M16SA-7TCN

16MB SDRAM chip
At qty 500, price is $1.76

Screen:

East Rising/BuyDisplay ER-TFT028-4 with optional touch screen
This is just the display, without the module
At qty 500, price is ~$6.13 + $1.06 with resistive touch panel

Resistive touch controller:

Optional. Might be able to use the ADCs in the CPU for this.

The XPT2046 can be obtained very cheaply from China:

https://www.utsource.net/itm/p/8377894.html?digipart=1

Cheapest price at qty 500: $0.15

Audio codec:

CS4344 (I think this would work)

We used the CS4344 last time and it worked fine. The STM32F746 supports
this chip just fine, and we can use the exact same clock settings.

At qty 500, the CS4344-CZZ price is: $1.72

Audio amplifier:

Last time we used the LM4880.

Price at qty 500: $0.92

LED control chip:

Last time we used the 31FL3736.

Price at qty 500: $1.22

Radio:

I would rather not deal with bluetooth again. I think we should use
one of the SemTech LoRa chips, in particular the SX1262 (915MHz version).
There is an MBed shield board available for this part which would be
ideal for development with the Discovery board (SX1262MB2CAS).

At qty 500, the SX1262IMLTRT price is: $4.99

Speakers:

We need to find a speaker that will fit in between the boards.
I don't know what to do for this yet.


Total:
$7.39 (MCU)
$1.23 (8 MB RAM)
$6.13 (screen)
$1.06 (resistive touch panel)
$0.15 (resistive touch controller)
$1.72 (audio codec)
$0.92 (audio amp)
$4.99 (radio)
$1.22 (LED chip)
