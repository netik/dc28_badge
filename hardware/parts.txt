Parts we'd probably like to have include the following (assumption is qty 500):

CPU:

ST Micro STM32F746 MCU
This part is available in several BGA and LQFN packages. Flash size is
either 512KB or 1MB.

Availability may be an issue. It's easier to get the WLCSP143 part,
and it's cheaper, but it only has 144 pins. This creates a problem:
there's an unresolvable conflict between the pin for LCD_B4 and the
FMC_D9 memory controller pin. This means it's not possible to use
more than 8 data pins with the FMC with this part, which limits the
possible RAM configuration to 4MB instead of 8MB. This is still
pretty good, but I'd rather have 8.

At qty 500, the STM32F746ZGY6TR price is $7.89

SDRAM:

ISSI IS42S16400J-6TL

8MB SDRAM chip
At qty 500, the IS42S16400J-6TL price is $1.23

Alliance Memory AS4C8M16SA-7TCN

16MB SDRAM chip
At qty 500, price is $1.76

Screen:

East Rising/BuyDisplay ER-TFT028-4 with optional touch screen
This is just the display, without the module
At qty 500, price is ~$6.13 + $1.06 with resistive touch panel

Resistive touch controller:

Optional. Might be able to use the ADCs in the CPU for this.

Audio codec:

CS4344 (I think this would work)

Radio:

???

I would rather not deal with bluetooth again.
