/*
 * This module uses the Memory Protection Unit in the Cortex-M4 to implement
 * some basic NULL pointer dereference detection. Trying to read or write
 * though a NULL pointer, e.g. address 0x0 or some close offset from it,
 * is a common coding problem. On most OSes running on application processors,
 * (e.g. Cortex-A), it's possible to trap these errors by reserving page 0
 * in the program's virtual address space and leaving it unmapped. That way
 * if any code tries to execute a load or store to or from address 0, the
 * MMU will trigger a fault right away.
 * 
 * On Cortex-M devices, you don't have an MMU, and address 0 typically the
 * start of on-board flash memory, as well as the default location of the
 * exception vector table. Performing reads to this location will not
 * trigger a fault, which means that if your code reads through NULL pointer,
 * it will not fail right away, but will instead load some value from the
 * vector table and try to use it as data. This may result in unstable
 * behavior or crashes at some later point which may be difficult to diagnose.
 *
 * But while the Cortex-M4 has no MMU, it does have an MPU, and we can use
 * it to set the access permissions on address space regions to trap
 * unexpected loads or stores just like an MMU can. Note that while the
 * CPU vector table is also stored at address 0, exception handling
 * doesn't seem to be negatively impacted by the change in access
 * protection.
